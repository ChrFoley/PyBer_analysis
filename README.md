# PyBer_analysis
## Background and Results

Analysis of totals for PyBer ride sharing. Specifically analyzed are:

    Total rides
    Total Drivers
    Total fares
    Average per fare
    Average fare per driver
    
Through analysing these metrics, we can show net earnings per driver, and for each fare.

Also within the analysis is a breakdown of time, showing utilisation rates during a defined time period.

### Purpose

  The purpose of this analysis is to identify trends within each of the three identified city types, Urban, suburban, and rural. this allows for identifcation of trends as to the fares that each type of environment is earning.

### Technical Analysis

  In order to achieve the desired breakdown, two CSV files were utilized:
    - city_data.csv which identifies the city name, the type of city, number of drivers in each.
    - ride_data.csv which breaksdown the individual rides which includes, ride id, fare, city, and date.
  
  Merging the two datasets allows for the ride data to be built into one unified dataframe and subsequently broken down into a usable product. Further breaking down the dataset, a new dataframe was built to show the five previously identified (review under analysis above) data points, the result is shown in fig 1. below.

### Summary

## Challenges Encountered and Overcome

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

* Programming

* Data analysis

* Graphing, etc

### Technical Analyses Used

## Recommendations and Next Steps

### Recommendations for Future Analysis

  Look at utilization rates, how often each driver is active
  look at the population, what percent uses ride share, drivers as a percent of population
